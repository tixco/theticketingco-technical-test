# Create T3 App

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.

## For your information

As you can see, this project is the boilerplate from create-t3-app.
We have only changed `src/app/_components/Post` and `src/server/api/routers/Post` to fit with our standards and best practices. The rest has been autogenerated by create-t3-app.
Make sure prettier and eslint tests pass!

## How do I start the app ?
  - Make sure you have Docker and Node.js installed
  - Copy paste the .env.example file to .env.
  - Start up a database, if needed using '`./start-database.sh`'
  - `npm run db:push`
  - `npm run dev`
